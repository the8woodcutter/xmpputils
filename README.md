### XMPP Utils
#### One day I was tossed some raw text on a webpage, and this was it, however slightly modified

***

* It was a guy or an admin from `home@room.telepath.im` muc on `telepath.im` server.
	* If this was you that made it, yea, I forked it, but email me please chunk et packets do cc
	* Thanks!

* Just create a virtual environment: Debian:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements
```

* Then run it from command line: `python xmpputils.py`
	- Answer da questions!
